To install FCKeditor for dasBlog:

These instructions will use the term <dasBlog> to represent the dasBlog web folder.

1) Copy newtelligence.DasBlog.Contrib.FCKeditor.dll to <dasBlog>\bin

2) Download version 2.2 of FCKeditor and FCKeditor.NET 
	http://www.fckeditor.net/
	http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=75348&package_id=137125

3) Copy FredCK.FCKeditorV2 (from FCKeditor.NET) to <dasBlog>\bin

4) Deploy the FCKeditor folder (from the FCKeditor distribution) as a direct subfolder of <dasBlog> 
 ex: <dasBlog>\FCKeditor

From http://wiki.fckeditor.net/Developer%27s_Guide/Installation :
Not all files are required by the editor to run and you could reduce the number and size of the files to be published in a production environment by removing:
    * All directories that start with an underscore (like _docs and _sample) including "editor/_source".
    * Any skins you are not using from the "editor/skins" directory.
    * Any "smiley" collections you are not using from the "editor/images/smiley" directory.
    * Any plugins you don't need from the "editor/plugins" directory.
    * Any connectors you don't need from the "editor/filemanager/browser/default/connectors" directory.
    * Any "fckeditor.ext" files you don't need from the root of the editor package (based on your server side language).
    
5) Copy the files in the SiteConfig folder of the FCK Contrib project to the <dasBlog>\SiteConfig folder.

6) Optionally, copy the FCKeditor folder included in Contrib package into the <dasBlog> folder, adding and replacing files in the existing <dasBlog>\FCKeditor folder.
   This step should only be performed if you downloaded v2.2 of FCKeditor. Future versions may be incompatible with these customizations.
   This step is only needed to pare down the default toolbar to buttons relevant to dasBlog usage, and to add the "Insert Code" button.

7) Login to your dasBlog installation and go to the Configuration page.

8) In the setting labeled "Editor control adapter", enter the following line, exactly as it appears:
newtelligence.DasBlog.Contrib.FCKeditorAdapter, newtelligence.DasBlog.Contrib.FCKeditor

9) Save your configuration.

10) Go to Add Entry and confirm the FCKeditor is displayed.
